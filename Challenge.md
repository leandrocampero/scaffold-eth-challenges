# Junior Solidity Role - Tech challenge

For the Junior Solidity Role no previous Web3 work experience is required but the role will challenge you in learning fast and bootstrap yourelf with new skills that will allow you to contribute to our team in an efficent manner.

The following challenge is designed as an entry low complexity test that will allow you to grasp into what Web3 is about and will allow us to get a feeling for your learning capabilities and skillsets.

## Decentralized Staking Application

You will be building a decentralized staking application based on the Scaffold-Eth Buidl Guidl challenge. Scaffold-Eth is a web3 application framework that allows you to bootsrap web3 applications.

Here are the goals to achieve for the task:

1. Complete the Scaffold-Eth Challenge using your local hardhat network
2. We will have a session where you will demo your challenge and this is what we will be asking so you can come prepared with a few slides or anotations in your README File.

- What challenges you encountered while completing the challenge
- Did you learn any new skills or subjects (such as what is staking)
- What were the resources that you used to complete it ( We will be looking how well you organized your research on topics you learnt about)
- How did you complete task #3 and where did you find the ETH Whale.

3. To add a level of complexity to the challenge you're required to pick an Ethereum Whale Account and impersonate it and use that account to create a test deposit to stake part of his available ETH balance.

The candidates that submit this task within a 1 or 2 day window after the first interview will be given priority for the Demo session.
